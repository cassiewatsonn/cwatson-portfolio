## Usage

Here is the deployed link to this application: [cwatson-portfolio](https://cassiewatsonn.github.io/cwatson-portfolio/)

To use this page, you can review each tab that will bring you to more information. For example: if you select "Projects" on the top of the page, it will direct you to the section of Cassandra's work. You will also find information like about me, contact me, resume, etc. You will also notice that most of the critical requirements necessary for the hiring process are shown.

In this single-page application portfolio, when I load the portfolio, then I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer. When I view the header, then I am presented with Cassandra's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio. When I view the navigation titles, then I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted. When I click on a navigation title, then I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted. When I load the portfolio the first time, then the About Me title and section are selected by default. When I am presented with the About Me section, then I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them. When I am presented with the Portfolio section, then I see titled images of six of Cassandra’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository. When I am presented with the Contact section, then I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. When I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, then I receive a notification that this field is required. When I enter text into the email address field, then I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address. When I am presented with the Resume section, then I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of Cassandra’s proficiencies. When I view the footer, then I am presented with text or icon links to Cassandra’s GitHub, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn profiles.
